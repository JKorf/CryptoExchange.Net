[![.NET](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/JKorf/CryptoExchange.Net/dotnet.yml?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/JKorf/CryptoExchange.Net/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml) [![Nuget downloads](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/CryptoExchange.Net.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CryptoExchange.Net) ![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/JKorf/CryptoExchange.Net?style=for-the-badge)

CryptoExchange.Net is a base library which is used to implement different cryptocurrency (exchange) API's. It provides a standardized way of implementing different API's, which results in a very similar experience for users of the API implementations. 
Note that the CryptoExchange.Net package itself can not be used directly for accessing API's. Either install a client library from the list below or use [CryptoClients.Net](https://github.com/jkorf/CryptoClients.Net) which includes access to all exchange API's.

For more information on what CryptoExchange.Net and it's client libraries offers see the [Documentation](https://jkorf.github.io/CryptoExchange.Net/).

### Current implementations
The following API's are directly supported. Note that there are 3rd party implementations going around, but only these are created and supported by me:
